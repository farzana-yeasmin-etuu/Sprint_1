This repository showcases my proficiency in **Git version control** through a series of tasks and operations.
It contains a series of Git tasks demonstrating my proficiency with branching, merging, rebasing, cherry-picking, reverting, squashing commits, deleting files, and stashing changes.

# Tasks Performed
 ### 1. Repository Setup
- Created a new GitHub repository and cloned it locally.

 ### 2. Initial Commit
- Added a basic program: "basic_program.cpp"
- Program prints **"Hello World"**.
- Committed the changes.

 ### 3. Branching and Merging
- Created a branch "feature-branch".
- Added a factorial program.
- Merged "feature-branch" into "main".

 ### 4. Rebasing
- Created "experimental-branch".
- Added a Fibonacci sequence program.
- Rebased changes onto "main".
- Handled  rebase conflicts.
### 5. Advanced Git Tasks

#### A. Cherry-pick
- Cherry-picked a commit with a critical fix from "feature-branch" into "main".

#### B. Revert Changes
- Reverted a faulty commit that introduced an error.
- Created a new intentional error in the Fibonacci code.

#### C. Reset (Soft, Mixed, Hard)
- Demonstrated and documented:
  - **Soft Reset**: Keeps changes staged.
  - **Mixed Reset**: Keeps changes but unstaged.
  - **Hard Reset**: Discards all changes.

#### D. Squash Commits
- **Why Squash?**
  - Simplifies commit history.
  - Makes the project cleaner and easier to review.

### 6. Deleting Files
- Deleted the basic program file.
- Committed the deletion.

### 7. Stashing Changes
- Stashed code changes in the basic program.
- Switched branches and reapplied the stash.
